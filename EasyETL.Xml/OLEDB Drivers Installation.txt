To download the 32 bit version of the Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 Provider, go here ==> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255

If you would like both 32 and 64 bit installed, check this out:

I recently got a new laptop and had to go through the ritual of reinstalling all my programs and drivers. I sometimes work with SSIS locally to import data from Excel and occasionally do demos with Power BI where I read from an Access database so I needed to install the ACE OLE DB provider.  If you try to do either of those things without the ACE OLE DB provider you will get a message like the one below.

The ‘Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0’ provider is not registered on the local machine.

I needed both the 32-bit and the 64-bit adapters to cover my various use cases. I started by installing the 64-bit Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable.  If you have ever attempted this, you know there is a secret. You cannot install the 2010 Access database engine with a different processing architecture (bittedness) from your Office install (or install both versions of the 2010 Access database engine) without a workaround.  If you try, you will get an error message.

ACE engine bittedness error

There are two options for getting the other version installed.

Option A: Install the 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components
The 2007 Access database engine can read the same format, but didn’t have a 64-bit install. It doesn’t have the check to see what other products are on your machine and can co-exist peacefully with the 64-bit 2010 Access engine.

Option B: Install from the Command Line and Use the Passive Switch
Open the command prompt.
Type the file path and file name for your Access Database Engine install file.
Follow it with a space and then “/passive” and then hit Enter.
Delete or rename the mso.dll registry value in the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\FilesPaths
Note: A helpful commenter has informed me that for Access 2016 the switch is /quiet rather than /passive.

I wrote up a document for this a while back for a client, but I can never remember where I put it. So I’m posting this on my blog to make this info easier to find for me as well as you.
